An open sentence is a sentence with a variable.
Exmaple:x<4
To turn an open sentence into a statement, we use sets and quantitifers.
A set is a collection of objects.
Each member of a set is an element.
Notation
1.List method:
Example: {1,2,3,4,5,6}
2.Set builder: {x:x∈Z and 1<=x<=5}
A={1,2,3,4,5}
write 3∈A. "3 is an element of A." "3 is in A."
7 is not an element of A. 7 is not in A. 7∉A
Quantifiers
Universal
For all, For each, For every
For all x in S, P(x)
This statement is true if P(x) is true for every value of x in S.

Example: Let A be {1,2,3,4,5}
For all x in A, x>=5
False
Symbols

Write actual words
∀x
Existential quantitifer
Example: Let A={1,2,3,4,5}
There exists x in A such that x is even.

Symbolically,
∃x∈A s.t. x is even

Examples
write in notation
1.For all x∈R, x^2+1>=0.
True
2There exists x∈N such that 3x-2=0.
False
Example write in words
3.
There exists x in the set of real numbers such that 3x-2=0
for all x in in integers, x^2-2>0

Negating quantitified statements
1 For all,
has negation there exists 
also P(x) becomes not P(x)

not(for all in S, P(x))=there exists x in S such that not P(x)

Examples
1. not(for all x in Z, x^2-2>0) 
There exists x in Z such that x^2-2<=0

2. not (for all x in R, x^2-5<=0)
There exists x in R such that x^2-5>0
3. not(for all x in Z, abs(x)>=1)
There exists x in Z such that abs(x)<1
